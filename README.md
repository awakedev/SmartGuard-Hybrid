# SmartGuard 
=======================

This is the web application and backend API for a University group project.

The application has been developed to provide awareness to possible dangers in remote areas such as mountains, woods, coastal routes and so forth. 

The application was requested by the Search and Rescue organisation in the North-West of England.
